Project to process French newspaper articles.

The goal of this project is to process French newspaper articles downloaded from the data base Lexis Nexis Academic.
Example files are provided in the "Prescribed1" folder.

This project has multiple steps:
1. Date processing:
    Newspaper articles have been archived in different ways on Lexis Nexis Academic, which resulted in different date formats. The first        major step of this project is to get rid of all unnecesary metainformation about the article, and to harmonize date formats from all sources.
